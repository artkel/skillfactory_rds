# Credit Scoring - Binary probabilistic classifier

## GENERAL INFORMATION

### Introduction

As part of this project, I built a credit scoring model based on a binary probabilistic classifier.

In machine learning, a probabilistic binary classifier is a supervised classifier that is able to predict, given an observation of an input, a probability distribution over a set of two classes, rather than only outputting the most likely class that the observation should belong to.

A credit scoring model is a mathematical model used to estimate the probability of default, which is the probability that customers may trigger a credit event (i.e. bankruptcy, obligation default, failure to pay, and cross-default events). In a credit scoring model, the probability of default is normally presented in the form of a credit score. The higher score refers to a lower probability of default.

Based on this score, a bank employee can make an educated decision, whether to issue a loan to a client, and if so, at what interest rate. Accurate and predictive credit scoring models help maximize the risk-adjusted return of a financial institution.
